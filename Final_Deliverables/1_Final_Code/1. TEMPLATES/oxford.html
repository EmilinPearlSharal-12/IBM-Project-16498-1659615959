    <h1>University of Oxford</h1>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>One of the most distinguished schools in the study abroad domain, Oxford University is a unique and historic institution that is documented as being the oldest English university in the world. While it is not clear when the University of Oxford was established, historians believe that teaching existed in some form at the University as early as 1096 (11th century.)

        One of the top universities, Oxford University continues to retain the top spot in the world university rankings. The university has been constantly ranked among the leading universities by QS World University Ranking, Times Higher Education (THE) World University Rankings, and the US News & World Report ranking to name a few.

        Against popular belief, Oxford University does not have a central campus. The Oxford University campus is segregated into 39 Oxford colleges, which are financially independent and self-governing but are connected to the central University in a federal system set up. There are also six permanent private halls, which are similar to colleges except that they tend to be smaller, and were founded by particular Christian denominations. The halls and colleges are close academic communities, which bring together students and researchers from different cultures, countries and disciplines.
        
        When we talk about Oxford University courses, all Oxford colleges offer the same excellence in teaching, but they vary in size, location and facilities. There are roughly 100 major academic departments which are governed by the Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Mathematical, Physical and Life Sciences; Faculty of Medical Sciences; and the Faculty of  Social Sciences. Each department organises teaching and research in a different subject area, from Anthropology to Zoology. There are also many smaller, specialist research centres and sub-departments. The University is also home to the largest library system in the UK with over 100 Oxford University libraries providing a wide range of library services that meet the needs of its students, academics and the international research community.
        
        When we talk about Oxford University admissions, for the academic year 2020-2021, almost 24,000 people applied for undergraduate study and over 40,000 people applied for graduate study. Oxford usually has around 3,300 undergraduate places and about 5,500 graduate places each year. For 2020-2021, 3,298 students were admitted to the undergraduate programme and 5,715 accepted to post-graduate positions at the University. Studying at Oxford University has always been a dream for many Indians, and today 41 per cent of students and 48 per cent of the academic staff at Oxford University hail from countries outside the United Kingdom.
